# Find In String

## Algorithm

> Step 1: Take a list of strings
> Step 2: Take input from user
> Step 3: Make dictionary to store values
> Step 4: Loop from 0 to length of the list
> Step 5: Add counter variable
> Step 6: Loop from 0 to length of ith of list and split it too
> Step 7: If the content of jth of list is equal to user input
> Step 8: Then increment counter
> Step 9: Dictionary of ith is equal to another dictionary with counter as key and list of strings ith as value
> Step 10: Loop from 0 to length of the dictionary
> Step 11: Loop from ith time to length of the dictionary
> Step 12: Get the counter of ith and jth from dictionary
> Step 13: If ith counter is less than jth counter, Swap them
> Step 14: Empty out list of strings
> Step 15: Now get the value from dictionary and append it to list of strings
