# Prime Factor

## Algorithm

> Step 1: Take input from user.
> Step 2: Create empty list to store factors.
> Step 3: Write for loop from 1 to the nth plus 1.
> Step 4: If n is divisible by i and is equal to 0.
> Step 5: Then, append that number to the list.
> Step 6: Write for loop through list.
> Step 7: Add counter variable.
> Step 8: Write another loop from 1 to i plus 1.
> Step 9: If i and j divides and is equal to 0.
> Step 10: Then increment counter.
> Step 11: If counter is equal to 2.
> Step 12: Print it's a prime factor.
