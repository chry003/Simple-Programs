# Split-It-Out

## Algorithm

* Step 1: Take a list of numbers
* Step 2: Create two variables and store the first value of list
* Step 3: Loop from 0 to length of list
* Step 4: If the largest variable is smaller than the current value
* Step 5: Then change it to current value and also store the index of current value
* Step 6: If the largest value is not equal to current value and second largest value is smaller than the current value follow Step 5 again
* Step 7: Calculate the difference between largest and second largest value
* Step 8: Print the value from 0 to the stored index add it to to second largest with calculated difference value and lastly add second half of the list
