# Anagram

## Algorithm

> Step 1: Input two strings from user
> Step 2: Make lists and append values of strings
> Step 3: Create loop from length of list to -1 with step of -1 to reverse it
> Step 4: If the value of list ith is in next list
> Step 5: Then get the index of that value, pop from both
> Step 6: Else print they ain't anagrams
> Step 7: If both list are empty at the end of the loop then they are anagrams
