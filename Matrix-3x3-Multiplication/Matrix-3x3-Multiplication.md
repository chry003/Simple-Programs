# Matrix 3x3 Mulplication

## Algorithm

> Step 1: Create two Matrix of 3x3
> Step 2: Create Resultant Matrix of 3x3
> Step 3: Loop from 0 to length of Matrix
> Step 4: Add nested loop from 0 to length of Matrix
> Step 5: Add nested loop from 0 to length of Matrix
> Step 6: Multiply first(matrix) ith kth to second(matrix) ith jth to result(matrix) ith jth
> Step 7: Print the result
